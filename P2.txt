I used Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm to shuffle the letters. I found a good example of it on stackOverflow.

Known Bugs/Errors:
The new game button is only slightly functional. It correctly:
-Removes all letters from palette
-Places all letters in letter box
-sorts letters alphabetically
-Enables buttons again after finishing a game

It draws a new board but it is sorta wonky. It's smaller (not sure why) and often has some boxes slightly out of position. 

Instead of using new game button when testing, I have built the game so that it chooses a new game and redraws the board whenever the page is loaded. So once a game is finished, I suggest refreshing instead of new game. 

Other notes:
Players are allowed to shuffle when in the middle of placing a word. It shuffles the remaining letters and spaces around. (It's a feature, not a bug. I swear)

Questions and Answers:
1. It does not matter where this file is located, it runs whenever it is called by the browser. It does not run on a server.
2. With a generic filename, anyone would be able to run your game and see the source code in a browser. 
3. Players can view the source code and see the hardcoded correct words.
4. Nothing would be interactable. The script CGI file runs once and stops. It gives a result and returns it. We needed something that allowed clickable events and high interactivity from the users.
